# Udacity-Dog-Breed-Classifier

In this project, I used the trained neural network to classify images of dogs (by breeds) and compare the output with the known dog breed classification. 
I had a chance to build  functions, use command line arguments, test the runtime of the code, create a dictionary of lists, and more.
